# LaTex-template-mynote
This is a LaTeX book template for taking notes. 

- Most of the code comes from many places. Thank them!    
- I should constantly modify it until its code becomes standardized and the template becomes better.
- This is a process that requires a lot of energy and time, and it is also a valuable learning experience.    
- I hope it can witness my growth
